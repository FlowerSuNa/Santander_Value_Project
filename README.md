# Santander Value Prediction Challenge

Santander Group aims to go a step beyond recognizing that there is a need to provide a customer a financial service and intends to determine the amount or value of the customer's transaction. 
This means anticipating customer needs in a more concrete, but also simple and personal way. 
With so many choices for financial services, this need is greater now than ever before.

n this competition, Santander Group is asking Kagglers to help them identify the value of transactions for each potential customer.
